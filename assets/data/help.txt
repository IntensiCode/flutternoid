This plays very different to the original:

Enemies will attack and destroy VAUS!

Hold Space (or j) to force capture the energy ball even without the catcher power-up.

But release it quickly before it becomes unstable and explodes!

Use Shift (or k) to cause a plasma blast. Eliminate all enemies to gain extra blast energy.

Use the friction of VAUS to change the direction of the energy ball.

Note that the catcher mode is powerful enough to pull the energy ball back from the void below. (If not too far gone!)
