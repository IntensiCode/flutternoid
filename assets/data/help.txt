Hold Space (or j) to force capture the energy ball even without the catcher power-up.

But release it quickly before it becomes unstable and explodes!

Eliminate all enemies to gain extra energy.

Use the friction of VAUS to change the direction of the energy ball.

Note that the catcher mode is powerful enough to pull the energy ball back from the void below!
