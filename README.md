Found some lovely Pico-8 Arkanoid Clone assets on itch.io:

Haven't done an Arkanoid/BreakOut clone in a while.

So here is one more...

### To Do

There are a few bugs with the ball and enemies. Not really game breaking. You can always just quit and restart at the
same level.

The audio lag is annoying, however. It's much better in the desktop version. But I'll try to fix the web version, too.
This is probably the only major/primary open task atm.

I have some ideas for how to add Revenge Of DOH levels. But probably won't have time.
